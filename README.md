# My Token
This project aims to develop a simple token contract. It provides minting and burning features. 


## Getting Started
To test this contract you can either just copy and paste it in remix ide or test it locally in your code editors or ides.


### Executing program

We will first compile our program. We then move to deploy and run transactions.
We can observe Public Variables:
•	tokenName: "HARSH"
•	tokenAbbrv: "HAR"
•	totalsupply: 0
then we will copy the address and paste it in to mint addresss and add the balance 1000 and click on transact, we will check the total supply which will be 1000. 
Now we will burn 500 balance similarly and check the total supply which will be 500 now after burning.
